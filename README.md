**tl;dr** We combine the efficiancy of convolutional approaches with the expressivity of transformers by introducing a convolutional VQGAN, which learns a codebook of context-rich visual parts, whose composition is modeled with an autoregressive transformer.

## Requirements
A suitable [conda](https://conda.io/) environment named `taming` can be created
and activated with:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate taming
```

## Data Preparation

### CelebA
Create a symlink 'data/CelebA' pointing to a folder which contains the following files:
```  
.
  ├── identity_CelebA.txt
  ├── img_align_celeba
  ├── list_attr_celeba.txt
  └── list_eval_partition.txt
```
These files can be obtained [here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html).

### CelebA-HQ
Create a symlink `data/celebahq` pointing to a folder containing the `.npy`
files of CelebA-HQ (instructions to obtain them can be found in the [PGGAN
repository](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans)).

### FFHQ
Create a symlink `data/ffhq` pointing to the `images1024x1024` folder obtained
from the [FFHQ repository](https://github.com/NVlabs/ffhq-dataset).

## Running pretrained models

### S-FLCKR
Download the [2020-11-09T13-31-51_sflckr](TODO) and place it into `logs`. Run
```
streamlit run scripts/sample_conditional.py -- -r logs/TODO/
```

## Shout-outs
Thanks to everyone who makes their code and models available. In particular,

- The architecture of our VQGAN is inspired by [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion)
- The very hackable transformer implementation [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT)
- The good ol' [PatchGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)
